IssueControl.cs:
* Open button should be disabled when issue key is empty

JiraClient.cs:
* Authentication(): , save username/password and extract code to a ReAuthenticate() method
* GetIssueSummary() + PostWorklog():
    On response 401 unauthorized, call ReAuthenticate() and try again.
    If still 401, then exit

IssueControl.cs
* Create public property for ElapsedTime/Running/etc, to make it possible for MainForm to
  save/load times and state - maybe a state object? or a serialized string?

MainForm.cs
* Add setting for "Save timers" - 3 states:
    No save
    Save (pauses all timers)
    Save and keep running (remembers start-time for running issue)
