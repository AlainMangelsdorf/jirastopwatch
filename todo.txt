IssueControl.cs
* Create public property for ElapsedTime/Running/etc, to make it possible for MainForm to
  save/load times and state - maybe a state object? or a serialized string?

MainForm.cs
* Add setting for "Save timers" - 3 states:
    No save
    Save (pauses all timers)
    Save and keep running (remembers start-time for running issue)

* private member issues is redundant because of form.controls - change to a read-only dynamic property that returns a list of form.controls that are all of type IssueControl

* Check and display Jira online status - with timed event and threaded task
