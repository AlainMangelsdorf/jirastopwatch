Move all application settings from MainForm into separate class

Autocomplete issue-keys:
  - When writing issue-key: Autocomplete from current JQL filter
  - Choose current JQL filter from all of user's filters

Bug: On startup (and changing login info) - if REST auth API is slow to respond, the application hangs because authentication is done in main thread
